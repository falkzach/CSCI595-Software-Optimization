2.)
sorting the vector of keys and early stopping (similar to listing 7.3 with a break statement added) was the fastest. It could be improved by filtering the vector of keys to a list only including keys and eliminating the if statement. This was about 4x faster than iterating over all the keys.

3.)
largest array index: 2^b
constant insertions on perfect hash
constant lookup on perfect hash
log(n) insertions and lookups on a balanced tree
compute hash, look at memory as opposed to traversing pointers in a tree
