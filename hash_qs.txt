1.)

set of sets Took 17.6629 seconds
map of sets Took 14.9323 seconds

There is a slight performance increase over 8.1, even with the extra iteration over the map

set of universal hash Took 12.1699 seconds
map of universal hash Took seconds 14.072 seconds

note it took 12.1749 without the additional if %2 ==1, = 0 loop

i beleive the gain in performance in the set of sets had to do with contiguous memory space,
while with the maps, its points all over the place so we see no improvement using the map.

3.)
sizeof(unsigned long) returns 8 provides use that a long has 8 bytes, and therefor 64 bits
we can store a of t up to the size of 2^64.


I feel that I tried to do to many things this past week and the quality of my work here reflects that, I will try to do less better.
